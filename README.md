JAY-NPM
===================

Server for Single Page App relying on [Jay](https://github.com/jayJs/jay).  
Use [Node-Jay](https://github.com/jayJs/node-jay) as sample of usage.  

**Instant back-end**  
Database via Kaiseki and Parse.com.
Authentication based on FB SDK and jwt-simle tokens.  

##INSTALLATION  
(Assuming you have npm installed)  
```
npm install jay-npm  
```
Copy default_config.js to config.js and fill it with correct credidentials.  
In order for everything to work properly Facebook app and parse.com credidentials are required.  
Set config.jwtSimple.secret into a string of your own choice.  

##USAGE  
Jay frontend component calls "/api/j" for GET and POST calls.  
Jay-npm helps to repsond to these calls. This is an example of receiving and replying with an Express server.   ```
var Jay = require('jay-npm');

app.get('/api/j', function(req, res){
  Jay.get(req, res, function(data){
    res.json(data);
  });
});
```
Please note that for this sample also express needs to be installed.  
Check out [Node-Jay](https://github.com/jayJs/node-jay/blob/master/app.js) for a complete example.  

##API  
##FB SDK Authentication  
Facebook SDK is added and used for authentication.  

##ensureAuthenticated  
Compares users token with server token. If match is found the functions is fired, else error message is returned with response.  
```
app.post('/api/j', Jay.ensureAuthenticated, function(req, res){
  Jay.post(req, res, function(data){
    res.json(data);
  })
});
```
##get  
Retrieves data from Parse.com and returns as object.  
```
Jay.get(req, res, function(data){
  res.json(data);
});
```
##post  
Parses your formdata and saves it to Parse.com.
If files are added, they are separately uploaded to Parse and added to the object.  
Returns ObjectId.  
```
app.post('/api/j', Jay.ensureAuthenticated, function(req, res){
  Jay.post(req, res, function(data){
    res.json(data);
  })
});
```
